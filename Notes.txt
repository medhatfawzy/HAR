For the body_gyro_x feature, the mean was better at separating the stationary activities, 
but the std was better at separating the moving activities.

This can be used to divide the problem into two parts.
First, we separate the stationary activities from the moving activities.
Then we separate the moving activities into either walking, upstairs or, downstairs.

This way we can significantly reduce the number of features we need to use to solve the problem 
and the number of computations we need to do. 

The problem might end up being easier to solve this way, we actually might not need ML at all.

I'll try to argue that instead of needing X, Y, and Z features, 
we'll be able to classify the movement using only the X feature and the number of readings.

* The calculations for std in the train.csv are different from doing the calculations on the raw data.
